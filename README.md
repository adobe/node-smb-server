# SMB Server

A 100% javascript implementation of the [SMB][] file sharing protocol.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wanderview/node-smb.png)](https://travis-ci.org/wanderview/node-smb)

Or it will be, one day.

Currently this is a working area for implementing the protocol.  Its likely
that it will eventually get split up into multiple npm modules.
